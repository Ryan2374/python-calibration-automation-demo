# Python Calibration Automation Demo

This project demonstrates a simplified calibration automation workflow written in Python.
It mirrors real-world production calibration systems while using fully mocked instruments.

## Purpose
- Showcase Python automation skills
- Demonstrate clean separation of logic
- Model hardware-software integration safely
- Provide testable, maintainable code

## Features
- Calibration workflow orchestration
- Mocked instrument interfaces
- Validation with tolerance checking
- Unit tests for core logic

## Why Mocked Instruments?
Most professional calibration and test systems interface with proprietary hardware.
This project demonstrates the same architecture and control flow without exposing IP.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
